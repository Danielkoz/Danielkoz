# Hello, I'm Daniel K
<a href="https://linkedin.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about cybersecurity and constantly expanding my skills in ethical hacking, network security, and digital forensics.

## Objective

My journey in information technology has led me to develop a strong passion for cybersecurity, and I am now focused on transitioning into the field. With a BTEC Level 3 National Foundation Diploma in IT, the Google Cybersecurity Certification, and hands-on training from a Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I have been building practical experience in network security, ethical hacking, and threat analysis.

Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving Wireshark for network traffic analysis, penetration testing using Metasploit, and security monitoring techniques. My goal is to apply these skills in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can actively contribute to detecting and mitigating cyber threats.

Always eager to learn and improve, Iâ€™m continuously exploring new security tools, participating in CTF challenges, and expanding my expertise in cybersecurity. ðŸš€
